# Wait for one or more named workflow runs on a given head ref to
# finish, then exit non-zero if any didn't end in ``success``. Used by
# both ``wait-publish.sh`` (post-tag publish workflows) and the
# ``make ci-wait`` target (pre-merge PR CI), which is why the workflow
# names are arguments rather than baked in.
#
# Usage:
#   ./scripts/wait-runs.sh <head-ref> <workflow.yml> [<workflow.yml>...]
#
# Examples:
#   ./scripts/wait-runs.sh v0.16.1 publish-images.yml publish-npm.yml
#   ./scripts/wait-runs.sh release-tooling ci.yml
#
# Why this exists vs. plain ``gh run watch``:
#
# 1. ``gh run watch --exit-status`` returns 0 in some failure
#    scenarios — observed when watching a multi-job workflow whose
#    overall conclusion settles after ``status=completed`` first
#    appears. We belt-and-braces by **also** reading
#    ``gh run view --json conclusion`` after the watch returns and
#    failing if it isn't ``success``.
# 2. Spinning two parallel ``gh run watch``s in an agent loop is
#    expensive — each cross-cache wakeup costs more than the foreground
#    watch saves. Doing it in bash is one shell, no wakeups.
# 3. Tag- and branch-triggered workflows take a few seconds to register
#    after ``git push``, so we poll briefly to resolve the run id
#    before watching.

# - For a tag, ``git rev-parse <tag>^{}`` (note the ``^{}``)
#   dereferences the annotated tag to its commit.
# - For a branch, ``git rev-parse <branch>`` returns the local HEAD,

# - Falls back to ``HEAD`` if rev-parse fails — happens when the
#   caller passes something git doesn't know (a bare branch name
#   from a different worktree, etc.); in that case we degrade to the
#   old "most recent by branch" behaviour with a warning.
